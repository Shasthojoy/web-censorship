What Is It?
-------------

This is a collection of data from a number of sources, including GreatFire.org,
China Digital Times, Blocked on Weibo, and Twitter users to chart the moments
when former Chinese politician Bo Xilai's name became blocked or unblocked on
Chinese social network Sina Weibo. The speculation is that the authorities
blocked his name when online conversations got too unpredictable to control and
unblocked it when they sought to give netizens the space to criticize Bo. The
data spans from late 2011 to late 2013.
