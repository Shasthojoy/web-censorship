      <div style="clear:both;"></div><div align="justify">By <a href="http://japan.freetraveler.net/">http://japan.freetraveler.net/</a><br /><br /></div><div align="justify"></div><div align="justify">My father was taking a bath when he suddenly shouted, "Good heavens! I have a nosebleed coming from somewhere!"<br /><br />I wonder, just where on my father could a "nosebleed" have come from...?<br /><br /><br /><br />On the Hankyu Railway train, a boy of about 3 looked liked he had to pee.<br /><br />Child: "Mama potty."<br /><br />Mama: "Why don't you tell me sooner [hayaku]!"<br /><br />Then the child thought of something and said rapidly [hayaku], "Mamapotty."<br /><br /><br /><br />On the airplane to Okinawa, my father said pompously, "All of the islands of Okinawa have 'reference fish' [sanshouuo]!"<br /><br />That should be "coral reef [fish]" [sangoshouuo]!!<br /><br /><br /><br />On the "If I don't do it, who will?" sign inside a certain factory, the voicing marks on the ga of "who" were shaved off [changing dare ga, "who," to dare ka, "someone"] , making it "If I don't do it, someone will."<br /><br />And this company's future will be....<br /><br /><br /><br />The other day my sister was feeling blue because a boy had dumped her, so to comfort her my father meant to say "A person isn't [just] a face" but said "Your face isn't human."<br /><br /><br /><br />My mother was watching TV when a beautiful female announcer came on. My mother said with a smile, "It'd be nice if someone like that married into our family."<br /><br />But in my family the only guy is my father. Just who does my mother want a bride for?<br /><br /><br /><br />At the confectioner's my mother asked for the country-style (crushed) sweet red-bean soup, and I asked for the strained sweet red-bean soup.<br /><br />When the clerk asked, "Who (dochira) had the country-style (inaka)?" [but possibly "Where (dochira) is your hometown (inaka)?"], my mother answered instantly "Niigata prefecture."<br /><br /><br /><br />During a marital spat, my father meant to say to my mother "Idiot!" [bakamono] but mistakenly shouted "Ghost!" [bakemono].<br /><br />The quarrel got much worse.<br /><br /><br /><br />When my mother gets a headache, she puts ice on her forehead.<br /><br />Just the other day in the middle of the night, the pain got pretty severe. Through the darkness with her head swimming, she went to the kitchen. From the refrigerator she took out a plastic bag of ice that she'd put there in advance, put it on her forehead, and went back to sleep....<br /><br />The next morning when she woke up, thawed squid had rolled onto her pillow.<br /><br /><br /><br />One time when the family was gathered for dinner, my dad, who was mad about something, meant to say "Thanks to whom do you think you're able to eat this meal?!" but shouted "For whose benefit are you eating this meal?!"<br /><br />My sister and I answered, "For our own benefit." </div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><div align="justify">This incident happened recently in North Texas.<br /><br />A woman went boating one Sunday taking with her some cans of coke which she put into the refrigerator of the boat. On Monday she was taken to the hospital and placed in the Intensive Care Unit. She died on Wednesday.<br /><br />The autopsy concluded she died of Leptospirosis. This was traced to the can of coke she drank from, not using a glass. Tests showed that the can was infected by dried rat urine and hence the disease Leptospirosis.<br /><br />Rat urine contains toxic and deathly substances. It is highly recommended to thoroughly wash the upper part of soda cans before drinking out of them The cans are typically stocked in warehouses and transported straight to the shops without being cleaned.<br /><br />A study at NYCU showed that the tops of soda cans are more contaminated than public toilets (i.e).. full of germs and bacteria. So wash them with water before putting them to the mouth to avoid any kind of fatal accident.<br /><br />Please forward this message to all the people you care about.<br />(I JUST DID)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.advices.vaty.net/">http://www.advices.vaty.net/</a></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
