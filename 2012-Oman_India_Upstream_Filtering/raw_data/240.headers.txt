It was on one such occasion that he found that she just refused to sleep or rest because she was forced to be in chains. When outside gate was opened, she would just scritter away taking time to wander whole village for hours. So they kept her chained when they had to open gate. But she seemed to resist it.. Why our Alsatian dog felt restless? Describes Satish Seth Swan by Satish. Watch it on Myspace Videos.
